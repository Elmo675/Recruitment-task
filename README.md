# Flask Rest API

This application helps users with collecting raw data from internet.

## TO_DO
	- Automation testes:  curl posting  and geting from Api results and status	-
	- Docker set up and image creation
	- Upgrade get_photo function so it will always get photo from text
## Problems:
	- Problem with Docker instalation on Windows(some issues with the Windows Upgrade, very small amaount of memory on computer)
	- I tried to make process meneger and start many orders but i've spotet a problem with synchronization and some unknown errors,
		overall decided to put this problem on later
	- get_photo collect data based on 'img' pattern in string, whitch is risky because that pattern can be spoted anywhere
